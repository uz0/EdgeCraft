# Edge Craft - AI Development Guidelines

## üéØ Project Context
**Edge Craft** is a WebGL-based RTS game engine supporting Blizzard file formats with legal safety through clean-room implementation. Built with **TypeScript, React, and Babylon.js**.

---

## üö® CRITICAL: PRP-CENTRIC WORKFLOW (MANDATORY)

### üî¥ THE GOLDEN RULE

**EVERY PIECE OF WORK MUST BE TIED TO A PRP.**

**IF THERE IS NO PRP, STOP AND ASK THE USER WHICH PRP THIS WORK RELATES TO.**

**ALWAYS REFLECT UPDATES TO PRP**

**NO EXCEPTIONS. NO WORKAROUNDS. NO SHORTCUTS.**

### ‚ö° EXCEPTION: HOTFIX & TRIVIAL COMMITS

**ONLY** for urgent production fixes or trivial changes, commits MAY bypass PRP requirement using these prefixes:

- **`HOTFIX:`** - Critical production bugs requiring immediate fix (security, data loss, system down)
- **`TRIVIAL:`** - Typo fixes, comment updates, formatting-only changes (NO logic changes)

**Requirements:**
- Commits MUST start with prefix: `HOTFIX: Fix critical auth bypass` or `TRIVIAL: Fix typo in README`
- Hotfixes MUST be followed by a PRP within 24 hours documenting root cause and prevention
- Trivial changes MUST NOT modify any business logic, algorithms, or behavior
- All other work (features, refactors, non-critical bugs) REQUIRES a PRP before starting

**Examples:**
```bash
# ‚úÖ ALLOWED without PRP:
git commit -m "HOTFIX: Fix SQL injection in user login endpoint"
git commit -m "TRIVIAL: Fix typo in CLAUDE.md (compliant ‚Üí complaint)"

# ‚ùå NOT ALLOWED without PRP:
git commit -m "Fix user authentication bug"  # Not urgent ‚Üí needs PRP
git commit -m "Refactor login logic"  # Not trivial ‚Üí needs PRP
```

---

## üìã WHAT IS A PRP?

**PRP = Product Requirement Proposal**

A PRP is the **ONLY** allowed format for documenting work. Every business logic change, feature, bugfix, or improvement MUST have a PRP.

**PRP Directory Structure:**
```
PRPs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2.13-complete-map-validation-closure.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ w3u-reforged-parser-fix.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ asset-credits-validation.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {descriptive-name}.md
```

**Rules:**
- ‚úÖ **Flat structure** - All PRPs directly in `PRPs/` directory
- ‚úÖ **Descriptive names** - `{feature-or-bugfix-description}.md`
- ‚ùå **No subdirectories** - No `PRPs/phase1/`, `PRPs/features/`, etc.

---

## üìù PRP STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)

Every PRP MUST contain EXACTLY these sections (no more, no less):

```markdown

## üö¶ AI AGENT WORKFLOW (MANDATORY RULES)

### BEFORE STARTING ANY WORK

**1. ALWAYS IDENTIFY CURRENT PRP**

```
User: "Fix the terrain texture bug"

CORRECT RESPONSE:
"Which PRP is this work related to? I need to know the PRP file name so I can:
1. Read the PRP to understand context
2. Update Progress Tracking
3. Ensure my work aligns with DoD
4. Mark appropriate checklist items

Please provide the PRP filename (e.g., 'terrain-texture-splatmap-fix.md')"
```

**2. IF USER DOESN'T SPECIFY PRP**

```
User: "Add new feature X"

CORRECT RESPONSE:
"I don't see a PRP for this work. Before I start, we need to:

1. Create a new PRP following the 3-phase process:
   - System Analyst: Define goal & DoR
   - AQA: Add quality gates & testing requirements
   - Developer: Technical planning & design

Would you like me to:
a) Help create a new PRP for this feature?
b) Check if there's an existing PRP this relates to?
c) Wait while you specify the PRP filename?

Note: I cannot proceed without a PRP - this is a mandatory workflow requirement."
```

**3. READ PRP BEFORE CODING**

```bash
# ALWAYS start by reading the PRP
cat PRPs/{prp-filename}.md

# Check DoR is complete
# Review Research / Related Materials
# Understand DoD requirements
# Review existing Progress Tracking
```

**4. UPDATE PRP DURING WORK**

After EVERY significant change:
- Add row to Progress Tracking table
- Check off DoD items as completed
- Update "Current Blockers" or "Next Steps"
- Commit PRP changes with code

**5. VERIFY QUALITY BEFORE CLAIMING DONE**

```bash
# ALWAYS run before marking work complete
npm run typecheck  # Must pass
npm run lint       # Must pass
npm run test:unit  # Must pass
npm run test:e2e   # Must pass (if E2E tests exist)
```

### DURING DEVELOPMENT

**Update PRP Progress Table (use ROLES not names):**
```markdown
| Date       | Role      | Change Made                          | Status      |
|------------|-----------|--------------------------------------|-------------|
| 2025-01-19 | Developer | Implemented terrain splatmap shader  | Complete    |
| 2025-01-19 | AQA       | Added unit tests (coverage 92%)      | Complete    |
| 2025-01-19 | Claude    | Fixed TypeScript errors              | Complete    |
```

**Check DoD Items:**
```markdown
## ‚úÖ Definition of Done (DoD)

- [x] Terrain shader supports 4-8 textures
- [x] Unit tests >80% coverage
- [ ] E2E test for terrain rendering (AQA to add)
- [x] No TypeScript/ESLint errors
- [ ] Code review approved
```

### COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

‚ùå **WRONG:**
```
User: "Fix bug X"
Assistant: *Starts coding immediately*
```

‚úÖ **CORRECT:**
```
User: "Fix bug X"
Assistant: "Which PRP should I work on? Please provide the filename from PRPs/ directory."
User: "PRPs/w3u-reforged-parser-fix.md"
Assistant: *Reads PRP first, then starts work*
```

‚ùå **WRONG:**
```
Assistant: *Completes work*
Assistant: "Done! The feature is implemented."
```

‚úÖ **CORRECT:**
```
Assistant: *Completes work*
Assistant: *Updates PRP Progress Tracking table*
Assistant: *Checks off DoD items*
Assistant: *Runs all tests*
Assistant: "Work complete. Updated PRP with progress. All tests passing. Ready for review."
```

---

## üìè CODE QUALITY RULES

### File Size Limit
- **HARD LIMIT: 500 lines per file**
- Split into modules when approaching limit

### TypeScript Standards
```typescript
// ‚úÖ DO: Use explicit types
interface UnitData {
  id: string;
  position: Vector3;
  health: number;
}

// ‚ùå DON'T: Use 'any'
function processUnit(unit: any) { } // FORBIDDEN
```

### Testing Requirements
- **Minimum: 80% unit test coverage** (enforced by CI/CD)
- Test files: `*.unit.ts`, `*.unit.tsx`
- Framework: Jest + React Testing Library
- E2E: Playwright

**Every business logic change MUST have tests. No exceptions.**

---

## üõ°Ô∏è LEGAL COMPLIANCE

### Zero Tolerance Policy
- **NEVER include copyrighted assets** from another games
- **Use ONLY original or CC0/MIT licensed** content
- **Run validation before EVERY commit**: `npm run validate:all`

---

## üìä VALIDATION PIPELINE

### Pre-Commit Checks (5 steps)
```bash
npm run typecheck          # TypeScript: 0 errors
npm run lint               # ESLint: 0 errors
npm run test:unit          # Tests: All passing
npm run validate:licenses  # Licenses: 0 blocked
npm run validate:credits   # Assets: Properly attributed
```

### CI/CD Workflows
- **validation.yml** - TypeScript, ESLint, Unit Tests, Licenses, Credits
- **ci.yml** - Full pipeline (Lint, Tests, Security, Build, E2E)
- **e2e-tests.yml** - Playwright E2E tests

---

## üö® WORKFLOW VIOLATIONS & ENFORCEMENT

### ‚ùå VIOLATIONS

**1. Working Without PRP**
- **Violation**: Starting code changes without specifying PRP
- **Action**: STOP immediately. Ask user for PRP filename.

**2. Skipping Quality Gates**
- **Violation**: Marking work complete without running tests
- **Action**: Run all validation checks. Fix failures.

**3. Not Updating PRP**
- **Violation**: Making changes without updating Progress Tracking
- **Action**: Update PRP before committing code.

**4. Incomplete DoD**
- **Violation**: Claiming work done with unchecked DoD items
- **Action**: Complete all DoD items or ask for clarification.

### ‚úÖ ENFORCEMENT

**AI Agent Rules:**
1. **ALWAYS** ask for PRP if not specified
2. **ALWAYS** read PRP before starting work
3. **ALWAYS** update PRP during work
4. **ALWAYS** run tests before claiming done
5. **ALWAYS** check DoD before marking complete

**If unclear which PRP to use:**
```
"I need clarification on which PRP this work relates to.

Current PRPs in PRPs/:
- 2.13-complete-map-validation-closure.md
- w3u-reforged-parser-fix.md
- asset-credits-validation.md

Which PRP should I work on, or should I help create a new one?"
```

---

## üéØ QUICK REFERENCE

### Starting New Work
```bash
# 1. User specifies or I ask for PRP
# 2. Read the PRP
cat PRPs/{prp-name}.md

# 3. Verify DoR complete
# 4. Review Research section
# 5. Understand DoD requirements

# 6. Implement following PRP design
# 7. Update Progress Tracking after each change
# 8. Check off DoD items as completed

# 9. Run validation before claiming done
npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run test:unit

# 10. Update PRP status and progress
# 11. Commit PRP + code together
```

### Creating New PRP
```bash
# 1. System Analyst: Goal + DoR
# 2. AQA: Quality Gates + Testing
# 3. Developer: Technical Design + Research
# 4. All review and finalize
# 5. PRP status: üìã Planned
```

### Daily Workflow
- [ ] Which PRP am I working on?
- [ ] Have I read the PRP recently?
- [ ] Is my work aligned with PRP DoD?
- [ ] Have I updated Progress Tracking?
- [ ] Have I run tests?
- [ ] Are there any blockers to document?

---

## üìö REMEMBER

**The PRP-Centric Workflow:**
1. `CLAUDE.md` ‚Üê You are here (workflow rules)
2. `README.md` ‚Üê Project overview
3. `PRPs/` ‚Üê ALL work is defined here

**If it's not in a PRP, it doesn't exist.**

**Every change requires:**
- ‚úÖ PRP defining the work
- ‚úÖ Progress tracking updates
- ‚úÖ Tests confirming functionality
- ‚úÖ DoD items checked off
- ‚úÖ Quality gates passing

**This workflow ensures:**
- üéØ Clear objectives (PRPs define work)
- üìä Measurable progress (Progress Tracking)
- üö¶ Transparent status (DoD checklists)
- ‚úÖ Quality assurance (Tests + validation)
- üîÑ Continuous improvement (Review feedback)
- üìù Single source of truth (No doc drift)

**Follow this workflow. Trust the process. Ship quality code.** üöÄ
