# PRP: Legal Framework & IP Compliance

**Status**: üìã Planned (DoR Phase)
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Complexity**: Critical
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 weeks (research + implementation)

## üéØ Goal / Description

Establish comprehensive legal framework for EdgeCraft organization addressing:
- IP ownership structure (Daria 30%, Vasilisa 40%, 30% reserve)
- Organization jurisdiction selection (Portugal vs Cyprus vs Delaware)
- Asset replacement strategy and timeline
- SLK file usage legality determination
- Risk assessment and mitigation for Blizzard copyrighted content
- DAO/donation legal infrastructure

**Business Value**:
- **Legal Protection**: Minimize risk of DMCA takedown or lawsuit
- **Investor Confidence**: Clear IP ownership and legal structure
- **Community Trust**: Transparent compliance and asset replacement plan
- **Strategic Clarity**: Know what we can/cannot use legally

## üîë Key Goals Alignment (2025-10-27)

### System Analyst Focus
- Map the legal pathway for reimplementing Warcraft III custom map mechanics (e.g., Dota) by documenting case law on idea/expression, derivative works, and interoperability defenses so we know exactly what gameplay behaviour can be mirrored without infringing Blizzard IP.
- Define a contributor and porting policy for legacy custom campaigns that requires original map authors to attest to rights, captures their license grant to EdgeCraft, and explains acceptable content transformations (data format conversion only, no Blizzard art or music redistribution).
- Produce an AGPL-first licensing strategy that keeps the engine and tooling free/open while clarifying how optional proprietary content or blockchain modules interface without violating copyleft obligations.
- Draw the explicit "red line" checklist separating safe clean-room reproduction versus infringing usage (SLK metadata, lore text, cinematic assets), including escalation points for legal counsel review.
- Coordinate with the blockchain PRP so any in-game token, NFT, or marketplace feature inherits the same compliance limits and never reintroduces Blizzard-derived assets or storylines.

### AQA Quality Gates
- Deliver the gameplay reproduction legal memo and attestation templates with dual review (internal compliance + external counsel) documented before marking DoD complete.
- Build acceptance tests that simulate importing a Warcraft III custom map, sanitize its assets, and verify the pipeline rejects Blizzard art, music, or lore strings while accepting mechanics-only data.
- Automate AGPL compliance checks (dependency scans, source availability verification) and track sign-off milestones for every release that bundles blockchain integrations or community mods.

### Developer Research Hooks
- Prototype the clean-room data conversion pipeline that extracts mechanics (triggers, pathing, unit stats) into EdgeCraft-native schemas without copying binary assets or creative expression.
- Evaluate manifest validation and hashing tools that enforce the red-line checklist, including quarantine workflows for suspect files and guidance for community replacements.
- Design integration points for privacy-preserving token rewards so blockchain telemetry and licensing obligations stay decoupled while still enabling future audits.

- [ ] **6 months** (progressive replacement during beta)
- [ ] **12 months** (full replacement by version 1.0)

**CEO Decision**: _____________

**Q2.2**: What is the budget for asset replacement?
- **Textures**: ~50-100 terrain textures @ $X each = $Y total
- **3D Models**: ~200-500 models (cliffs, doodads, units) @ $X each = $Y total

## üî¨ Research Required (Before DoR Can Be Checked)

### Legal Research
1. **DMCA Section 1201(f) Applicability**
   - Does reverse-engineering Blizzard file formats qualify as "interoperability"?
   - Can we legally extract SLK data if we implement our own SLK parser?
   - Does "clean-room implementation" extend to game data structures?

2. **Jurisdiction Comparison Matrix**
   - **Portugal**: Non-profit registration process, crypto donation laws, tax treatment
   - **Cyprus**: IP holding structure, crypto regulations, EU compliance
   - **Delaware**: C-corp vs LLC, securities law for tokens, IRS crypto reporting

3. **Asset Replacement Precedents**
   - Research how OpenRCT2, OpenMW, OpenRA handled asset replacement
   - Find case studies of game engines that transitioned from copyrighted to original assets
   - Document timeline, budget, community contribution models

### Technical Research
4. **SLK File Content Analysis**
   - Percentage of SLK data that is "creative" vs "functional"
   - Legal opinion: Is texture name mapping copyrightable? (e.g., "Ashen_Dirt" ‚Üí ID 4)
   - Alternative: Can we create our own texture metadata format?

5. **Asset Replacement Roadmap**
   - Prioritize critical assets (terrain textures, cliff models)
   - Identify low-risk replacements (generic textures like "grass", "dirt")
   - Estimate artist time: hours per texture/model

## üìö Research / Related Materials (2025-10-27)

### Legal Precedent Digest
- *Sega v. Accolade* (1992) and *Sony v. Connectix* (1999) confirm that reverse-engineering for interoperability is lawful if no copyrighted assets are redistributed, reinforcing our clean-room stance for file formats and engine behaviour replication.
- *Micro Star v. FormGen* (1998) ruled that distributing user levels bundled with original art constituted an infringing derivative work, underscoring that any Warcraft III port must exclude Blizzard textures, models, music, and lore verbatim.
- *Blizzard v. Valve* (2012) over the DOTA trademark illustrates that custom map authors can convey rights to their unique contributions but do not gain ownership over Blizzard IP; we must secure explicit contributor assignments for any legacy campaign imports.
- *Lewis Galoob v. Nintendo* (1992) highlighted that ephemeral gameplay modifications are permissible when no fixed copy is created, meaning we can mirror mechanics (damage formulas, ability behaviour) so long as no Blizzard expressive content ships with EdgeCraft.
- EU idea/expression doctrine and US case law both protect abstract mechanics and game systems, but names, storylines, and distinctive visual/audio elements remain off-limits without licensing.

### Safe Porting & Contributor Controls
- Require contributor representations that they own (or have retained) the rights to all non-Blizzard creative content in the map; provide a templated assignment granting EdgeCraft a perpetual, irrevocable license to redistribute converted materials under AGPL-compatible terms.
- Build an ingestion checklist that automatically strips or blocks Blizzard BLP/DDS textures, MDX models, voice lines, music, scripted dialog, and canonical lore strings during conversion.
- Maintain provenance logs for every imported map to document author identity, original publication date, and proof of consent, creating a defensible audit trail if takedown claims arise.
- Document the ‚Äúred line‚Äù matrix: mechanics logic, numeric balance, trigger flow, unit stats = ‚úÖ; art assets, cinematics, Warcraft race names, campaign text, music cues, hero likenesses = üö´ unless independently recreated.

### Licensing & AGPL Interface Notes
- Core engine and tooling remain AGPL; optional blockchain connectors or proprietary asset packs must interact via network/service boundaries to avoid copyleft contamination.
- Provide dual-license guidance for community submissions: code contributions under AGPL, creative assets under CC-BY or custom permissive terms that allow redistribution within EdgeCraft while avoiding Blizzard dependencies.
- Coordinate with blockchain PRP so smart contracts, NFT metadata, and token reward systems never encode Blizzard-owned identifiers or textures, preventing accidental derivative works through on-chain data.

### Open Questions
- Confirm whether ported custom campaign authors retained rights if their work incorporated Blizzard cinematics or voice lines (likely no); need legal review before allowing such imports.
- Validate DMCA 1201(f) applicability when distributing tooling that parses SLK data but not the original files‚Äîcounsel opinion required.
- Determine if localization text databases require redaction (Warcraft-specific jargon) or if generic replacements suffice for first release.
