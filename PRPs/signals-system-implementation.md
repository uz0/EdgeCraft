# PRP: Signals System Implementation

## üéØ Goal
Implement comprehensive Signals System for workflow enforcement, violation detection, and project status tracking in Edge Craft. Deploy signal-aware AI agents, automated CI/CD checks, and complete documentation infrastructure to prevent future workflow violations and enable transparent project monitoring.

## üìå Status
- **State**: üü° In Progress ‚Üí Review Pending
- **Created**: 2025-10-28
- **Branch**: `feature/signals-system-implementation`
- **Base Branch**: `dcversus/seattle`

## üìà Progress
- ‚úÖ Analyzed conversation history for signal patterns (2025-10-28)
- ‚úÖ Designed Signals System with WHY/HOW/WHAT structure (2025-10-28)
- ‚úÖ Created `.claude/subagents.yml` with 10 specialized agents (2025-10-28)
- ‚úÖ Created `.claude/skills.yml` with 15 reusable skills (2025-10-28)
- ‚úÖ Updated CI/CD pipeline with signal-check job (2025-10-28)
- ‚úÖ Created signal-aware PR template (2025-10-28)
- ‚úÖ Created 3 issue templates (bug, feature, signal) (2025-10-28)
- ‚úÖ Updated CONTRIBUTING.md with Signals System docs (2025-10-28)
- ‚úÖ Updated README.md with signal workflow (2025-10-28)
- ‚úÖ Updated .gitignore with prevention patterns (2025-10-28)
- ‚úÖ Resolved Signal #1 (Documentation Violation - 9/10) (2025-10-28)
- ‚úÖ Resolved Signal #2 (Backup Files - 4/10) (2025-10-28)
- ‚è≥ PENDING: Code review and approval

## üõ†Ô∏è Results / Plan
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure Complete**: 2,500+ lines of signal enforcement code
- ‚úÖ **Violations Resolved**: Both critical signals (9/10, 4/10) fixed
- ‚úÖ **Prevention Deployed**: CI/CD blocks future violations
- ‚è≥ **Review Required**: Awaiting stakeholder approval before merge

**Business Value**: Prevents workflow violations (documentation discipline, quality gates), enables transparent project monitoring, automates compliance checking, and provides structured handoff mechanisms between development phases.

**Scope**:
- Signal detection and reporting system (0-10 strength scale)
- AI agent configuration for workflow enforcement
- CI/CD integration with merge blocking
- Documentation updates (Three-File Rule enforcement)
- Issue/PR templates with signal awareness
- Prevention mechanisms (.gitignore, pre-commit checks)

## üß† System Analyst ‚Äî Discovery

### Signal System Requirements
- **Primary Objective**: Prevent workflow violations through automated detection and enforcement
- **Signal Strength Scale**: 0-10 (Info ‚Üí Warning ‚Üí Critical ‚Üí Incident)
- **Structure**: WHY (reason), HOW (plan), WHAT (result) for each signal
- **Automation**: CI/CD integration with merge blocking for critical signals (>= 6)

### Identified Signals (2025-10-28)
1. **Signal #1**: Documentation Discipline Violation (9/10 INCIDENT)
   - Cause: Created `docs/` directory violating Three-File Rule
   - Impact: Documentation fragmentation, source of truth unclear

2. **Signal #2**: Uncommitted Backup Files (4/10 WARNING)
   - Cause: *.backup, *.old files left in repository
   - Impact: Technical debt, version control bypassed

3. **Signal #3**: PRP Research Phase Complete (2/10 INFO)
   - Milestone: MPQ Compression Module Extraction research done
   - Impact: Ready for implementation handoff

4. **Signal #4**: HeroScene Landing Animation Complete (2/10 INFO)
   - Milestone: Landing page animation feature complete
   - Impact: Ready for browser testing

5. **Signal #5**: Implementation Phase Not Started (6/10 CRITICAL)
   - Cause: Research complete but Phase 0 not executed
   - Impact: Blocks merge, research staleness risk

### Stakeholder Requirements
- **Workflow Enforcement**: Prevent documentation outside PRPs/, CLAUDE.md, README.md
- **Automated Detection**: CI/CD must scan and block violations
- **Agent-Driven**: AI agents should detect, report, and remediate signals
- **Merge Protection**: Critical signals (>= 6) must block PR merges
