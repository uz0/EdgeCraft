## 🗂️ Phase Structure

### **[Phase 1: Foundation - MVP Launch Functions](./phase1-foundation/1-mvp-launch-functions.md)**
**Status**: 📋 In Progress (14% complete)
**Duration**: 6 weeks | **Budget**: $30,000 | **Team**: 2 developers

**What It Delivers**:
- Babylon.js rendering engine @ 60 FPS
- Advanced terrain system (multi-texture, LOD, quadtree chunking)
- GPU instancing for 500+ units
- Cascaded shadow maps
- W3X/SCM map loading pipeline
- Rendering optimization (<200 draw calls, <2GB memory)
- Automated legal compliance pipeline

**Sub-PRPs**: 1.1-1.7 (detailed in comprehensive document)

### **[Phase 2: Advanced Rendering & Visual Effects](./phase2-rendering/2-advanced-rendering-visual-effects.md)**
**Status**: 📋 Planned (Scope Validated - 8.5/10 Confidence)
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks | **Budget**: $20,000 | **Team**: 2 developers

**What It Delivers**:

- Advanced lighting system (8 dynamic lights)
- GPU particles (5,000 @ 60 FPS)
- Weather effects (rain, snow, fog)
- PBR material system
- Custom shader framework
- Decal system (50 texture decals)
- Render target system (minimap)
- Quality preset system (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/ULTRA)

**Key Revisions** (Evidence-Based):
- Particles: 50,000 → 5,000 (10x reduction)
- RTTs: 3 → 1 minimap only
- SSAO/DoF: Deferred to Phase 10
- Quality presets: Now MANDATORY

### **[Phase 3: Gameplay Mechanics](./phase3-gameplay/3-gameplay-mechanics.md)**
**Status**: 📋 Planned (Post-Phase 2)
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks | **Budget**: $25,000 | **Team**: 2-3 developers

**What It Delivers**:
- Unit selection & control system
- Command & movement system
- A* pathfinding system
- Resource gathering & economy
- Building placement & construction
- Unit training & production
- Combat system prototype
- Fog of war & vision system
- Minimap system
- Basic AI opponent
- Deterministic game simulation loop

**Milestone**: First playable RTS prototype (gather → build → fight)
