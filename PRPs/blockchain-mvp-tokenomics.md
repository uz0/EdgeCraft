# PRP: Blockchain MVP & Tokenomics

**Status**: üìã Planned (DoR Phase - BLOCKED by PRP Legal Framework)
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Complexity**: High
**Estimated Effort**: 8-12 weeks (design + implementation + audit)

## üéØ Goal / Description

Design and implement blockchain infrastructure and token economics for EdgeCraft:
- Token utility definition (governance, access, rewards, marketplace)
- Distribution model (founders 30%+40%, community, treasury, investors)
- Blockchain platform selection (Polygon recommended)
- Smart contract development (token, DAO, staking, marketplace)
- Donation infrastructure (crypto + fiat)
- Compliance strategy (avoid securities classification)

**Business Value**:
- **Community Ownership**: DAO governance gives players voice in game direction
- **Sustainable Funding**: Crypto + fiat donations fund development
- **Creator Economy**: Tokenized marketplace rewards map/mod creators
- **Network Effect**: Token incentivizes user growth and retention

## üîë Key Goals Alignment (2025-10-27)

### System Analyst Focus
- Align with the legal PRP to decide whether a privacy-preserving network (Aztec, zk rollups, or similar) can host an anonymous in-game currency without triggering securities or money-transmitter exposure; capture decision criteria and required legal sign-offs.
- Draft the yellowpaper structure covering total supply, 40% gameplay reward pool for "LLM token sharing" (player-provided compute/token allowances), DAO treasury splits, and guardrails that keep the system AGPL-friendly and free-to-play aligned.
- Define comparative hypotheses that prove blockchain integration improves retention/monetisation versus a non-chain rewards system, including measurable KPIs and fallback plan if compliance costs outweigh benefits.
- Scope a pilot for optional NFT inventory attachments (e.g., ERC-1155 loadouts) that respects lore/original-assets guidelines and keeps ownership/licensing boundaries clear.
- Identify gating dependencies: Legal green-light on derivative works policy, privacy law review for anonymous rewards, and operational readiness for treasury custody.

### AQA Quality Gates
- Build a validation matrix that documents anonymity guarantees (zero-knowledge proofs, relayer trust model) and records compliance/legal approval before any mainnet deployment.
- Simulate the 40% player reward distribution across varied engagement cohorts to ensure fairness, anti-sybil protections, and treasury solvency thresholds are met.
- Establish pre-launch audit criteria covering smart contracts, privacy infrastructure, AML/KYC posture, and stress testing for token emission plus NFT attachments.

### Developer Research Hooks
- Evaluate Aztec (or comparable privacy L2) SDK maturity, throughput, and relayer requirements to confirm it can sustain real-time in-game micro-rewards with acceptable latency and fees.
- Model the "share LLM tokens" mechanic: how off-chain compute/LLM allowances map to on-chain attestations, what oracle or proof system is needed, and how to prevent data leakage.
- Prototype inventory-linked NFT architecture (likely ERC-1155 with off-chain metadata) and outline how it syncs with EdgeCraft inventory without exposing Blizzard-derived content.
- Investigate wallet abstraction or account abstraction flows that keep the anonymous internal currency easy to onboard while respecting AGPL distribution requirements and parental controls.

**Dependencies**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **BLOCKED**: Legal Framework PRP must be complete first
- Organization jurisdiction affects token classification
- Securities law compliance depends on token design
- DAO structure depends on legal entity type

## üî¨ Research Required (Before DoR Can Be Checked)

### Legal Research
1. **Securities Law Analysis**
   - Apply Howey Test to EdgeCraft token design
   - Research "safe harbor" frameworks (e.g., SEC guidance on utility tokens)
   - Identify jurisdictions with crypto-friendly regulations (Switzerland, Singapore, Portugal)

2. **DAO Legal Structure**
   - Research DAO legal wrappers (Wyoming DAO LLC, Swiss Foundation)
   - Liability protection for DAO members
   - Tax treatment of DAO treasury

3. **Token Sale Compliance**
   - If token sale planned: KYC/AML requirements
   - Accredited investor rules (if security token)
   - Crowdfunding regulations (Reg CF, Reg A+ in USA)

### Technical Research
4. **Blockchain Platform Comparison**
   - Gas fees: Ethereum vs Polygon vs Arbitrum
   - Transaction speed: Block time, finality
   - Developer tools: SDKs, indexers (The Graph), wallets
   - Gaming ecosystem: Existing games on each platform

5. **Smart Contract Audits**
   - Research audit firms: OpenZeppelin, CertiK, Trail of Bits
   - Cost: $5,000 - $50,000 depending on complexity
   - Timeline: 2-4 weeks

6. **Token Distribution Mechanisms**
   - Airdrop tools: Merkle drop, claim contracts
   - Vesting contracts: Cliff, linear unlock, milestone-based
   - Staking contracts: Simple yield vs governance staking

### Economic Research
7. **Tokenomics Benchmarks**
   - Research gaming token models: Axie Infinity (AXS), Decentraland (MANA), Immutable X (IMX)
   - Analyze supply/demand dynamics
   - Model token price scenarios (best case, base case, worst case)

8. **Treasury Management**
   - DAO treasury diversification (hold stablecoins vs native tokens)
   - Yield farming strategies (earn interest on treasury)
   - Risk management (hedging, insurance)

## üìö Research / Related Materials (2025-10-27)

### Privacy Network Comparison
- **Aztec**: Upcoming Aztec Network (Noir-based, private-by-default) targets ~200 TPS with hybrid rollup design; Connect sunset (2024) means production timeline uncertain, so pilot would rely on devnet/testnet and requires running our own sequencer/relayer. Strength: programmable privacy (shielded transfers, on-chain anonymity). Risk: immature tooling, limited wallet support; compliance review needed because fully private flows trigger regulatory scrutiny.
- **Polygon zkEVM**: Public, high compatibility with Ethereum tooling, ~30-50 TPS today, no native privacy. Could pair with third-party privacy layer (Railgun, zkMoney) for optional shielding but adds UX friction. Good for mainnet readiness and exchange liquidity.
- **Starknet**: Cairo-based, ~20 TPS currently with roadmap to higher throughput; account abstraction native (helpful for gas sponsorship). Privacy currently absent, though projects like ZKLend exploring. Needs custom Cairo dev skills.
- **zkSync Era**: EVM-like via LLVM transpilation, 2000+ TPS target, ecosystem growing; offers `zkPorter` for hybrid data availability but not privacy. Easiest path if anonymity requirement can be scoped to off-chain mixing.
- **Manta Pacific / Secret Network**: Provide privacy features (Celestia DA for Manta, TEE-based for Secret) but smaller ecosystems; TEEs raise trust concerns for AGPL alignment.

### Currency Architecture Insights
- For the 40% gameplay reward pool, model emissions using `rewardPerBlock = (annualRewardPool / blocksPerYear)` with dynamic difficulty: scale rewards by `playerShare = individualContribution / totalContribution`, where contribution = verified LLM token allotments + in-game time. Apply anti-sybil caps by binding contributions to soulbound reputation NFTs or staked collateral.
- Implement dual-bucket treasury: 40% player rewards (streamed via vesting contract), 30% community grants (map creators), 20% operations, 10% reserve. Vesting contracts should be upgrade-resistant (use OpenZeppelin `CliffVesting` + timelock governor).
- Anonymous payouts require relayer-operated shielded pools (Aztec or alternative). If Aztec unavailable, consider building on Polygon with Semaphore-style zero-knowledge claims: players submit proofs of weekly activity to claim payouts without exposing addresses.

### NFT Pilot Considerations
- Prefer ERC-1155 for inventory attachments (stackable items, skins). Metadata stored on IPFS/Arweave with hashes recorded in manifest; ensure all art is original or procedurally generated to comply with legal PRP.
- Implement opt-in bridging: NFTs only unlock cosmetic inventory slots; gameplay effects remain server-authoritative to avoid pay-to-win perceptions.
- Track provenance in `PlaySession` structs so rewards can reference both fungible tokens and optional NFT drops from the same proof-of-play attestation.

### UX & Compliance Notes
- Account abstraction (EIP-4337) or Sequencer-sponsored transactions needed for frictionless onboarding; evaluate Biconomy or native Starknet AA depending on chosen chain.
- Integrate privacy disclosures and parental controls: shielded currency must allow voluntary transparency (view keys) when required by law or tournaments.
- Draft fallback plan: if privacy chain not production-ready, release on public L2 with obfuscation limited to off-chain reward escrow until compliance counsel signs off on full anonymity.

### Open Questions
- Can we source or operate a compliant relayer network that keeps user data anonymous while still blocking sanctioned addresses?
- What oracle infrastructure will attest to ‚ÄúLLM token sharing‚Äù without revealing proprietary usage data? Explore ZK-proof-of-resource.
- How do we sunset or migrate tokens if privacy chain changes (Aztec delays)? Need upgrade/migration clause in yellowpaper.
