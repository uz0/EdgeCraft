# Phase 3+ Research Summary - Executive Briefing

## üéØ Mission Accomplished

I've completed comprehensive research and planning for **Phases 3-6** of Edge Craft, defining the critical path from rendering engine to production-ready game.

**Deliverables Created**:
1. ‚úÖ **Phase 3 Definition** - Game Logic Foundation (10 PRPs, 3 weeks)
2. ‚úÖ **Feature Request Framework** - Community engagement process
3. ‚úÖ **Roadmap Phases 3-6** - Detailed 16-week plan to alpha release

## üìã What Was Delivered

### 1. Phase 3 Definition & Scope
**File**: [PHASE3-DEFINITION.md](./PHASE3-DEFINITION.md)

**What It Defines**:
- **10 PRPs** covering unit selection, pathfinding, resources, combat, fog of war
- **3-week timeline** with parallel development tracks
- **Success metrics**: 500 units @ 60 FPS in combat, playable prototype
- **Budget**: $25,000 (2-3 developers)

**Key Insight**: Phase 3 transforms Edge Craft from a beautiful renderer into an actual playable game. Without this foundation, the editor (strategic plan Phase 3) would be meaningless.

**PRPs Overview**:
| PRP | Feature | Days | Priority |
|-----|---------|------|----------|
| 3.1 | Unit Selection & Control | 3 | Critical |
| 3.2 | Command & Movement | 4 | Critical |
| 3.3 | Pathfinding (A*) | 5 | Critical |
| 3.4 | Resource System | 3 | High |
| 3.5 | Building Placement | 4 | High |
| 3.6 | Combat System | 4 | High |
| 3.7 | Fog of War | 3 | High |
| 3.8 | Minimap | 2 | Medium |
| 3.9 | Unit AI & State Machine | 3 | High |
| 3.10 | Game Simulation Loop | 2 | Critical |

## üéØ Strategic Alignment

### Original Strategic Plan
The attached strategic plan defines:
- **Months 1-3**: Basic renderer
- **Months 4-6**: Advanced rendering
- **Months 7-9**: Editor MVP
- **Months 10-12**: Community alpha (100 testers)

### How This Research Aligns

| Strategic Phase | Roadmap Phases | What's Different |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| Months 1-3: Renderer | Phases 0-2 | ‚úÖ Same |
| Months 7-9: Editor | **Phases 3-4** | üîÑ Split into game logic + editor |
| Months 10-12: Alpha | **Phases 5-6** | üîÑ Multiplayer + polish |

**Key Refinement**: The strategic plan's "Editor MVP" assumes playable game logic exists. This research identified that **Phase 3 (Game Logic)** is a prerequisite that wasn't explicitly defined.

## üö® Critical Dependencies

### Phase 1-2 Must Complete First
Phase 3 **cannot start** until:
- ‚úÖ Babylon.js integration complete
- ‚úÖ Advanced terrain rendering working
- ‚úÖ GPU instancing for 500+ units
- ‚úÖ Map loading (W3X/SCM) functional

**Current Status**: Phase 1 is 14% complete (1/7 PRPs done)
**Timeline Impact**: If Phase 1-2 take 6-8 weeks, Phase 3 starts in ~2 months

### External Repository Dependencies
**Phase 5 Multiplayer** requires:
- ‚úÖ core-edge server (https://github.com/uz0/core-edge)
- ‚úÖ Colyseus client integration
- ‚úÖ Deterministic simulation from Phase 3

**Action Required**: Set up local core-edge dev environment before Phase 5

## üí∞ Budget Summary

| Phase | Duration | Team | Cost |
|-------|----------|------|------|
| Phase 3 | 3 weeks | 2-3 devs | $25,000 |
| Phase 4 | 4 weeks | 3-4 devs | $40,000 |
| Phase 5 | 4 weeks | 3 devs | $30,000 |
| Phase 6 | 4 weeks | 3-4 devs | $35,000 |
| **Subtotal** | **15 weeks** | **Avg 3 devs** | **$130,000** |
| Contingency (10%) | - | - | $13,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **16 weeks** | - | **$143,000** |

**Strategic Plan Budget Check**:
- Original Phase 1 budget: $30k (Phases 0-2 in new roadmap)
- Original Phase 2 budget: Likely $50-60k
- Original Phase 3 budget: Likely $60-70k
- **New Phases 3-6**: $143k

**Alignment**: Roughly equivalent to original Phases 2-3 combined.

## üéì Key Insights from Research

### 1. Game Logic is a Prerequisite for Editor
**Why**: You can't build a meaningful map editor without:
- Unit selection (to place units)
- Pathfinding (to test unit movement)
- Combat (to validate balance)
- Resources (to configure starting economy)

**Implication**: Phase 3 must come before editor work begins.

---

### 2. Multiplayer Requires Deterministic Simulation
**Why**: Lockstep networking only works if simulation is 100% deterministic.

**Implication**: Phase 3's game simulation loop must be designed with multiplayer in mind from day one.

---

### 3. Community Features Drive Engagement
**Why**:
- Warcraft 3 succeeded because of custom maps
- StarCraft 2 Arcade created content ecosystem
- Dota 2 Workshop generates revenue

**Implication**: Editor (Phase 4) and workshop (Phase 6) are critical for long-term success.

---

### 4. Legal Compliance is Ongoing, Not One-Time
**Why**: Assets added in every phase need validation.

**Implication**: Feature request framework must include legal review step.

---

## üîÑ How This Fits into Overall Roadmap

### Current Master Roadmap (ROADMAP.md)
Defines **12 phases** with 180+ PRPs:
- Phase 0: Project Bootstrap (15 PRPs)
- Phase 1: Core Engine (18 PRPs)
- Phase 2: Rendering (16 PRPs)
- Phase 3: Terrain System (14 PRPs)
- Phase 4: Asset Pipeline (12 PRPs)
- Phase 5: File Format Support (15 PRPs)
- Phase 6: Game Logic Core (16 PRPs)
- Phase 7: UI Framework (14 PRPs)
- Phase 8: Editor Tools (18 PRPs)
- Phase 9: Multiplayer (17 PRPs)
- Phase 10: Advanced Features (15 PRPs)
- Phase 11: Polish (12 PRPs)

### New Phase 3+ Definition
This research **refines and extends** the master roadmap:
- **Phase 3 (new)**: Game Logic Foundation = Old Phase 6 (Game Logic Core)
- **Phase 4 (new)**: Editor MVP = Old Phase 8 (Editor Tools)
- **Phase 5 (new)**: Multiplayer = Old Phase 9 (Multiplayer)
- **Phase 6 (new)**: Advanced Features = Old Phase 10 (Advanced Features)

**Why the numbering changed**:
- User's context suggested Phases 1-2 are "already done" (rendering)
- Logical next step is game logic (new Phase 3)
- Editor comes after game logic exists (new Phase 4)

## üéØ Recommended Phase Sequence

### Most Logical Order:
```
Phase 0: Bootstrap (in progress, 3/15 done)
   ‚Üì
Phase 1: Core Engine + Rendering (1/7 done)
   ‚Üì
Phase 2: Advanced Rendering (post-processing, particles)
   ‚Üì
Phase 3: Game Logic Foundation ‚Üê THIS DOCUMENT
   ‚Üì
Phase 4: Editor MVP
   ‚Üì
Phase 5: Multiplayer Infrastructure
   ‚Üì
Phase 6: Advanced Features & Polish
   ‚Üì
Phase 7+: Production launch, ongoing support
```

### Why This Sequence?
1. **Foundation first**: Can't build features without engine
2. **Playability before editing**: Need game logic to test maps
3. **Single-player before multiplayer**: Validate game mechanics offline first
4. **Core features before polish**: Get MVP working, then enhance
