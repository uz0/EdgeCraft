# Stakeholder Alignment Notes (2025-10-24 Sync)

Participants: Product (Elena S.), Engineering (Ravi P.), Legal (Mina K.), Security (Jon L.), DX (Vasilisa V.)

Key outcomes:
- MVP scope locked to **solo capture → reconstruction → solo playback**; shared sessions deferred to Phase 2.
- Consent UX to ship with dual opt-in (capture + optional cloud reconstruction).
- DX requested CLI tooling for QA capture uploads; engineering agreed to prototype alongside browser flow.
- Legal/Security approved research timeline with gating items recorded in respective reviews.
- Next checkpoint: 2025-11-05 executive review with updated prototype demo.
