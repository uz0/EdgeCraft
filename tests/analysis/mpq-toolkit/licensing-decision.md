# Licensing Decision Record

- Recommended license: **Apache-2.0** (legal ticket LEG-5127).
- Rationale: patent grant needed for potential compression algorithm contributions; compatible with MIT/Apache deps; aligns with Edge Craft open tooling strategy.
- SPDX header plan: add `SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0` to extracted files.
- NOTICE file to include acknowledgements for StormLib documentation and Blizzard MPQ format references.
- Maintainer responsibilities: publish security policy (SEC-28 template) and triage SLA < 72h for critical issues.
