# E2E Test Infrastructure Status

## ✅ Completed

### Infrastructure Setup
- ✅ Playwright installed and configured (1.56.0)
- ✅ Test directory merged into `tests/e2e/`
- ✅ Fixtures and helpers in `tests/e2e-fixtures/`
- ✅ Screenshot baseline directory in `tests/e2e-screenshots/`
- ✅ Docker configuration in `tests/e2e-docker/`
- ✅ CI/CD integration via `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`
- ✅ Map files served via `public/maps` symlink

### Configuration
- ✅ playwright.config.ts with WebGL optimization
- ✅ 120s test timeout, 30s expect timeout
- ✅ Sequential execution (workers=1) for WebGL stability
- ✅ Screenshot comparison with 5% threshold

### Critical Fixes
- ✅ **Canvas initialization bug fixed** in `src/App.tsx:267-271`
  - Canvas now renders on page load (hidden when gallery shown)
  - Babylon.js renderer initializes properly
  - MapRendererCore ready for map loading

- ✅ **TypeScript errors fixed** in helpers
- ✅ **Map serving verified** - maps load correctly via `/maps/` endpoint

### Working Tests (7/7 passing in 8.9s)

#### smoke.spec.ts (4 tests)
- ✅ Gallery loads with 24 maps
- ✅ Search filter (Sentinel maps)
- ✅ Format filter (W3N campaigns)
- ✅ Visual regression screenshot

#### smoke-extended.spec.ts (3 tests)  
- ✅ Babylon.js renderer initializes
- ✅ Map count validation
- ✅ Map selection triggers (detects onClick)

## ⚠️ Known Issue: React Event Handler in Tests

### Problem
Playwright's `click()` method doesn't trigger React's `onClick` handler in the test environment.
- Manual testing: Map loading works perfectly
- E2E tests: Clicks don't trigger `handleMapSelect`

### Root Cause
React event handlers (synthetic events) don't always fire from Playwright's DOM manipulation.
Attempts made:
- Regular click()
- Force click()
- dispatchEvent()
- Direct React props access (works but causes async issues)

### Workaround for Map Render Screenshots
Until React event triggering is resolved, use manual testing for map render validation:

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Manually test map loading:
# 1. Open http://localhost:3000
# 2. Click "EchoIslesAlltherandom.w3x"
# 3. Wait for map to render
# 4. Take browser screenshot (Cmd+Shift+4 on Mac)
# 5. Save to tests/e2e-screenshots/manual/
```

## 📊 Test Coverage

| Category | Status | Count |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Gallery UI | ✅ | 4 tests |
| Renderer Init | ✅ | 1 test  |
| Map Selection | ✅ | 2 tests |
| Map Rendering | ⚠️ Manual | 0 automated |
| **Total** | | **7 automated** |

## 🔜 Next Steps

1. **Research React + Playwright integration** for synthetic events
2. **Consider alternative approaches**:
   - Use `@testing-library/react` for component tests
   - Create API endpoint to trigger map load programmatically
   - Use Puppeteer instead of Playwright (different event model)
   
3. **Interim solution**: Document manual test procedure for map renders

## 🚀 Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
npm run test:e2e

# Specific test file
npm run test:e2e tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts

# Update screenshots
npm run test:e2e:update-snapshots

# View report
npx playwright show-report
```
