/**
 * Coordinate System Conversion Utilities
 *
 * mdx-m3-viewer uses Z-up (WebGL/Warcraft 3 standard):
 *   X = horizontal (east-west)
 *   Y = depth (north-south)
 *   Z = vertical (up-down)
 *   Up vector: [0, 0, 1]
 *
 * Babylon.js uses Y-up (3D graphics standard):
 *   X = horizontal (east-west)
 *   Y = vertical (up-down)
 *   Z = depth (north-south)
 *   Up vector: [0, 1, 0]
 *
 * Conversion: [mdx_x, mdx_y, mdx_z] -> [babylon_x, babylon_y, babylon_z]
 *             [x, y, z] -> [x, z, y]
 *
 * This is equivalent to a 90Â° rotation around the X-axis:
 * - X stays the same
 * - Y becomes Z
 * - Z becomes Y (with sign flip for proper handedness)
